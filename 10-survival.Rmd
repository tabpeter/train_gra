# Survival (time-to-event) analysis 

Survival analysis is one of the problem-solving settings that separates biostatistics from pure statistics. Survival analysis research questions ask, "How long until (some event) happens?". This is a messy question, especially in biomedical research contexts where the investigators do not observe what happens to every observational unit (e.g, every patient) in the study. A patient may come to the clinic once, receive treatment, and then never come back to the clinic again. Whatever outcome the investigators wanted to observe remains unknown for that patient -- we would say the outcome for such a patient is *censored*. 

The most-used methods in survival analysis are the *log-rank test* and the *Cox proportional hazards model*. The log-rank test is a conceptual analog to a [Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochran%E2%80%93Mantel%E2%80%93Haenszel_statistics) in categorical data analysis. When working with a survival outcome and a single categorical predictor, the log-rank test can be used to test the null hypothesis: â€œthere is no difference in survival between the groups being compared." The Cox proportional hazards model is a multivariate regression approach in which the exponentiated coefficients are the *hazard ratios*.

## Examples: 

  - Clinical trials: patients battling a chronic condition are randomized to either new drug B or the standard of care drug A. Patients have follow-up visits once per month for 1 year to monitor the time until their symptoms flare up again (e.g., time to relapse or time to recurrence). 
  
  - Dentistry: electronic dental records are used to assess the time until re-intervention for crown margin repairs (CMRs). CMRs are compared to assess which materials last longer: glass ionomer, resin-modified glass ionomer, resin-based composite, and amalgam. 
  
  
  - Industry/manufacturing: Suppose there are four machines on a factor floor, two from brand A and two from brand B. The time until next malfunction could be used to compare the two brands of machines.
