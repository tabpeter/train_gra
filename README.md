Welcome! 

This is an in-development draft of a reference manual for training new biostatistics graduate research assistants (GRAs). The objective of this manual is to equip new biostatistics GRAs to produce readable, rigorous, and reproducible results. Topics covered include: 

  - How to get organized in the first 3 days of your new GRA job 
  
  - How to get started on the command line 
  
  - R packages and tips for various data types (e.g., survival data, survey data, microbiome data, GWAS data, and more)
  
  - Tips for cultivating professionalism (e.g., responding to peer reviewers, maintaining a CV, writing professional emails)

Although the main objective pertains to biostatistics/biostatisticians, some principles of this book are applicable to other fields/careers. If this compilation of best practices, suggestions, and references serves to raise the caliber of content output by even one other person, then the author will consider her work worthwhile. 


The author, T. K. Peter,  is a master's level biostatistician working at the [University of Iowa College of Dentistry](https://dentistry.uiowa.edu/research/biostatistics-and-computational-biology), and a PhD candidate studying with [Prof. Patrick Breheny](https://myweb.uiowa.edu/pbreheny/) in the [University of Iowa College of Public Health](https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/). 

This reference manual is being written using R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
