# Data processing and preparation 

One of the most challenging aspects of a project can be preparing the data for analysis. In real life, our data seldom looks like something from `mtcars`: 


```{r}
knitr::kable(
  head(mtcars[, 1:8], 10),
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Canonical example of clean data'
)
```


Instead, I often receive data that looks like this:

Instead of Google searching how to handle each step of processing data like this, this chapter will offer a step-by-step outline of the whole game. I will show you what packages and strategies I used to prepare these data for analysis in R. 

## Start with a sketch 

When I need to process raw data, I like to begin by sketching ... 


## Reading in the data 



## Making data 'square' 


## Making data 'long form'
