# Motivation 

The meta-question behind this short book is 'where to begin?'. I started graduate school in August of 2019, coming straight from an undergrad program in math to a doctoral program in biostatistics. In the same week that I started classes, I started my work as a graduate research assistant in the [Division of Biostatistics and Computational Biology](https://dentistry.uiowa.edu/research/biostatistics-and-computational-biology) at the University of Iowa College of Dentistry. It was a steep learning curve. Now heading into my 5th year as a Ph.D. student, I began compiling some notes/tips to share with the other graduate research assistants (GRAs) who joined our team after me. Those notes have become this reference manual. 

The 'first principles' chapter is me diving into the philosophy of why I think this kind of training manual is important. Here, I'll give you the TL;DR: Although a significant component of graduate level study is learning how to learn, brand new GRAs also need to know what to Google. GRAs need to struggle with hard concepts and new ideas -- the learning is truly in the struggle. At the same time, they need to know where to start. This creates a tension: new GRAs need to engage in independent study work, but they also need resources that outline guiding principles. If GRAs don't know what they're searching for, they won't know if they've found it. Moreover, if novice GRAs *think* they know what they are searching for without any guidance, they could easily come across bad advice (by 'bad', I mean that which leads to suboptimal outcomes with respect to rigor and reproducibility). 

With this tension in mind, the goal of this reference manual is to 1) outline some of the main ideas that you will need to be successful, and 2) to provide you with some vocabulary to help you as you learn independently. Many of the chapters here outline some general concepts and then provide links to further reading.


## What this book assumes 

This is a reference manual, not a formal textbook. As such, my philosophy in writing this is to summarize the most helpful things I have learned in a way that is conducive to quick review. The chapters that are titled after broad areas of research (e.g., 'survival analysis') contain more links than new content. I assume throughout this writing that the readers are either familiar with foundational statistical concepts or are currently enrolled in courses that are teaching those concepts. 

## Acronymns {#acronyms}

Throughout this work, I use the following acronyms: 

  - **GRA**: Graduate research assistant
  - **PI**: Primary investigator 
  - **CC**: Carbon copy (as in an email)
  - **UI**: University of Iowa 
  - **HPC**: High performance computing 
  - **SAS**: [Statistical Analysis System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_(software)) software
  - **GWAS**: Genome-wide association study 
  - **QC**: quality control 

## Working with the garage door open 

This manual is a work in progress. I am writing this as I work my way through my own program, making notes as I go. This is in the spirit of [working with the garage door open](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu), an approach to learning that really resonates with me. 

Keep in mind that as I'm writing this, I am also a student myself. I want to make improvements to this manual as I keep learning. If you think of a reference that you'd like to see included, open a GitHub issue or make a pull request to let me know. I would welcome any feedback, and would appreciate any thoughtful critiques. 

## Acknowledgements 

So much of this work comes directly from what I have learned from my dissertation advisor [Patrick Breheny](https://myweb.uiowa.edu/pbreheny/) and my GRA supervisor [X. Jin Xie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=flqLOJIAAAAJ). Both of these men have had a tremendous influence on my thinking. 

I also want to thank the other UI biostats professors who have taught my core courses; our department is stacked with faculty who are dedicated teachers as well as brilliant researchers.


## Dedication 

This work is dedicated in loving memory of my father, [Bill Peter](https://www.hendersonvillefh.com/obituary/William-Peter) (1955-2022).
